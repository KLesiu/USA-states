# USA-states
This is my page about all states in USA. 
I created this page to practise my skills of front-end. I learned grid and flex box, so i wanted to use them. I love America so the topic could not be otherwise.
It's my third page in my programming adventure but, it is first which i published to the internet.
09.11.2022- Finished page. I learned how grid work. I practised my flexbox skills and i feel good with it. I feel very comfortable when i use it. I created responsive page so im very proud of this.This is my huge private succes.
**PROBLEMS**
I dont know how media screen works at css. I tried to used it but it didnt work.
I cant optymalize page for mobile.
